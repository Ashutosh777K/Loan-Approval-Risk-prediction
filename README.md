# Loan Approval Risk Prediction Project

## Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

### Project Overview:

## Loan approval prediction is a crucial aspect of financial decision-making for

## banks and lending institutions. Automating this process using machine

## learning techniques helps reduce risks associated with loan defaults while

## ensuring fair and efficient approval mechanisms. The proposed system

## leverages historical loan data, applicant financial records, and credit scores

## to classify loan applications as either approved or denied.

### Project Title: Loan Approval Risk Prediction Project


### Project Abstract:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) can play a pivotal role in automating loan application
classification by analyzing unstructured financial and personal data. This study explores an
NLP- based approach to classify loan applications as likely to be approved or denied by
extracting meaningful insights from textual data such as financial history, credit reports, and
applicant statements. By leveraging techniques like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and
text embeddings, the model enhances traditional credit assessment methods. Automating this
process with NLP not only improves efficiency but also helps lenders make more informed and
fair lending decisions while minimizing the risk of defaults.

### Algorithms Used:

### Conclusion:

In an NLP-based loan approval project, the choice of model depends on the complexity of text
data, accuracy requirements, and computational resources. Traditional machine learning
models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest can be effective for structured text
analysis, such as analyzing financial documents and customer profiles. However, for deeper
insights, deep learning models like LSTMs and CNNs can capture complex patterns in
application forms, credit history, and customer interactions. If the project involves advanced text
understanding, such as extracting sentiments from applicant statements or analyzing
unstructured financial documents, transformer-based models like BERT or GPT can provide
superior accuracy. While these models improve decision-making, they require significant
computational power.
